# DiffCrysGen [![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/pypi-v0.1.0-blue)](https://pypi.org/project/diffcrysgen/)

DiffCrysGen is a score-based diffusion model. It treats the entire materials representation with a single, unified diffusion process, allowing a single denosing neural network to predict a holistic score for the entire noisy crystal data. This unified treatment significantly simplifies the architecture and improves the computational efficiency.
